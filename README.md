# BlazorTron

BlazorTron is a simple project template for creating a new Blazor application that is running in Electron. 

While tinkering around with Blazor, I found it tedious to keep adding the same handful of settings to the project to get it to run in Electron, so I created this template.

This template will get you set up quickly with a new Blazor application that is running inside Electron!

## Usage

I am working on getting this template added to NuGet, but as of right now -
  - Clone this repo
  - Run ```dotnet new -i path\to\repo```
  - You should now be able to run ```dotnet new blazortron``` to create a new Blazor application running in Electron.
