# BlazorTron

BlazorTron is a simple project template for creating a new Blazor application that is running in Electron. 

While tinkering around with Blazor, I found it tedious to keep adding the same handful of settings to the project to get it to run in Electron, so I created this template.

This template will get you set up quickly with a new Blazor application that is running inside Electron!
